===

In order to use this plugin, you need to create a free **Yle Tunnus**.

Yle Tunnus can be created at <http://yle.fi/aihe/yle-tunnus>. After that you can see
your Yle API keys at <https://tunnus.yle.fi/api-avaimet>. To use the plugin those keys
must be entered through the plugins settings menu. Alternatively the keys can also be entered

Some content can only be viewed in Finland. Also some special content available in the Areena 
might not be playable via the API.
